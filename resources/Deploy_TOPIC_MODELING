			@@@ All the analysis is done in the JAVA part(feature Selection). Here we Just read the already constructed document vectors in order to create the Dictionary, Training Corpora and Topic Model @@@ 


			1. First step is to create the DICTIONARY:
			   Command:     python src/org/machine_learning/topic_modeling/CreateDictionary.py database_name usr psw  dictionary_output_file update_existed_dictionary numper_of_topics filter_extremes
			   				    
							    #Read document vectors from MySql
							    #Add document's vectors to GenSim Dictionary
							    #Save Dictionary into disk
					


			2. Second step is to create the TRAINING CORPORA:
			   Command:         python src/org/machine_learning/topic_modeling/CreateCorpus.py database_name usr psw  dictionary_file   corpus_output_file

			   				    
							    #Read document vectors from MySql
							    #Add document's vectors to GenSim Corpora
							    #Save Corpus into disk with Market Matrix Format

			
			3. Last step is to create the TOPIC MODEL:
			   Command:         python src/org/machine_learning/topic_modeling/TopicModeling.py  dictionary_file corpus_file model_output_file 

			   				    
							    #Load Dictionary and Corpus
							    #Transform Corpus to TF-IDF space
							    #LSI transformation of the TF-IDF model
							    #Save LSI model into disk for later usage
